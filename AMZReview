<Who am I, and how do I relate to the product>

BUY IT: <e.g. Yes, if your needs are simple, and price-point low.>

OVERVIEW:
<What the product is>
<apparent target market -- Cost, Quality, Heavy/Light use>
<Looks & Feels as advertised -- workmanship and materials>
<Specs as advertsed>
<Quality to write home about>
<Instructions easy to use?>

WHO SHOULD BUY IT:
Buy it if you need a simple set of fuss-free headphones to listen to some music and are not too fussed with quality (i.e. happy with headphones not made of money). The headphones are a very good buy for the price.
